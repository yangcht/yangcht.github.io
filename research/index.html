<p>Understanding the nature of the galaxies in the early Universe requires a full view of their interstellar medium by probing their molecular complexity. Therefore, we have conducted a series of line surveys with NOEMA and ALMA towards some of the brightest dusty galaxies at \(z>3\), including starburst-dominated galaxies as well as quasars. From the spectra, <strong>more than 20 molecular lines from 15 species</strong> from their rotational and vibrational spectra in each galaxy have been detected. They reveal the chemical richness and detailed properties of their interstellar media &#40;Yang et al. in prep.&#41;.   </p>

<h2 id="h_mathsf2o_in_galaxies_near_and_far"><a href="#h_mathsf2o_in_galaxies_near_and_far" class="header-anchor">H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O in galaxies near and far</a></h2>
<p>Water is one of the most important molecules in the Universe. In the gas phase interstellar  medium &#40;ISM&#41;, after molecular hydrogen, H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O is commonly the most abundant molecule together  with CO in the ISM of galaxies. While it remains mostly locked up in icy grains &#40;in solid phase&#41;  in the cold molecular ISM, it can be desorbed into gas phase in certain conditions  &#40;see e.g., <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cr4003177">van Dishoeck et al., 2013</a>&#41;.  Unlike CO, H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O can be excited via both collisions and by  absorbing far-infrared photons &#40;far-infrared pumping&#41;. The far-IR pumping  mechanism makes H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O line unique probes compared to standard gas tracers like  the CO line, e.g., <strong>H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O tells us not only about the gas conditions but most  importantly about the physical conditions of the far-IR radiation field such as the  dust temperature, optical depth and its physical size</strong>. Besides, H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O  traces various <strong>a variety of physical processes</strong> such as shocks and gas outflowing.</p>

<p>Because of the atmosphere, it is nearly impossible to observe H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O coming from  the nearby Universe from the ground. Therefore, space telescopes/observatories like <em>ISO</em>, <em>SWAS</em>, <em>Odin</em>, <em>Spitzer</em>, and <em>Herschel</em> are used in studies of H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O.</p>
<p>We have conducted a study of the extragalactic H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O lines among <strong>176 galaxies &#40;the largest sample for the first of its kind&#41;</strong> observed by <em>Herschel</em> SPIRE &#40;<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2013ApJ...771L..24Y/abstract">Yang et al. 2013</a>&#41;. The submillimeter H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O lines are found to be the second brightest molecular emitters after CO. The luminosity of the H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O lines &#40;\(L_\mathsf{H_\mathsf{_2}O}\)&#41; is close to being linearly correlated with infrared luminosity &#40;\(L_\mathsf{IR}\)&#41;, being consistent with the model that far-infrared &#40;far-IR&#41; pumping is dominating the H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O line excitation.</p>

<p>At high redshift, because that the submillimeter H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O lines have been shifted to lower frequencies, we can observe some of the H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O lines directly using ground-based  telescopes like <em>NOEMA</em> and <em>ALMA</em>.</p>
<h4 id="spatially_integrated_studies"><a href="#spatially_integrated_studies" class="header-anchor">Spatially integrated studies</a></h4>
<p>We have firstly selected a group of strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxies from  the <a href="https://www.h-atlas.org"><em>Herschel</em>-ATLAS</a> survey  and successfully detect H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O lines &#40;2\(_\mathsf{02}\)-1\(_\mathsf{11}\) and 2\(_\mathsf{11}\)-2\(_\mathsf{02}\)&#41; in seven submillimeter galaxies &#40;<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A&amp;A...551A.115O/abstract">Omont, Yang et al. 2013</a>&#41;, with NOEMA low spatial resolution configurations. We have thus studied   the global properties of the H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O lines. The results confirm that H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O   lines are among the strongest molecular lines in high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies.  In this sample, we also find a similar tight correction between \(L_\mathsf{H_\mathsf{_2}O}\) and \(L_\mathsf{IR}\), which confirms the far-infrared pumping dominance.</p>

<p>Following our initial study, we have further expanded the sample &#40;adding 11 more galaxies at \(z\sim2-4\)&#41;  and the transitions of the H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O lines &#40;both \(J_\mathsf{up}\) &#61; 2 and 3&#41; and  included H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O\(^+\) lines as well &#40;<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A&amp;A...595A..80Y/abstract">Yang et al. 2016</a>&#41;.

<p>In this study, we confirmed the tight linear correlation at high redshift with a larger sample. And most importantly, we explored the excitation of H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O lines for five of the galaxies which have  both \(J_\mathsf{up}\) &#61; 2 and 3 H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O lines detected.</p>

However, there are strong degeneracies. Thus, we need additional information, such as the velocity-integrated flux densities of J ≥ 4 H2O lines, to better constrain the physical parameters.

<p>Besides, we also discovered a very tight linear correlation between the line luminosity of H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O and H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O\(^+\). Since H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O\(^+\) is an intermediate in the chains of reactions among O, H\(^+\), H\(^+_3\), e\(^-\), cosmic rays, and H\(_2\). H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O\(^+\) lines can offer information regarding the ionization states of the ISM.  We find a tight correlation between H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O and H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O\(^+\), and the ratio  of H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O/H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O\(^+\) is about 3, suggesting a high cosmic-ray ionization rate  rate of 10\(^\mathsf{-14}\) s\(^{-1}\) to 10\(^\mathsf{-13}\) s\(^{-1}\).</p>

<p>Taking the advantages of the strong lensing effect &#40;which increases the spatial resolution&#41;, we have observed  one of the brightest lensed galaxies with ALMA &#40;<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A&amp;A...624A.138Y/abstract">Yang et al. 2019</a>&#41;. We have obtained high-spatial-resolution maps of CO, H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O, and H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O\(^+\) in a strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxy at \(z=3.6\). For the first time, we studied the spatial distribution of H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O emission at sub-kpc scales in the source plane and found that the emission of CO, H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O, and H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O\(^+\) are coincident.</p>

While the cold dust emission  is peaking in between two galaxies, in the interacting front, the CO and H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O gas emission are peaking  at the centers of each galaxy.

<p>Water lines are unique probes of the ISM conditions. In some cases, we can infer the structures of the ISM from spatially integrated observations &#40;without any resolved maps&#41; of multiple transitions of the H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O lines. </p>
<p>Recently, we have detected the 448 GHz H\(_\mathsf{2}\)O&#40;4\(_\mathsf{23}\)-3\(_\mathsf{30}\)&#41; at high redshift for the first time &#40;<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A&#37;26A...634L...3Y/abstract">Yang et al. 2020</a>&#41;, following the first detection in space by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017A&#37;26A...601L...3P/abstract">Pereira-Santaella et al. 2017</a> in ESO 320-G030. This 448 GHz transition is especially interesting because it can probe the deeply buried galaxy nuclei since the line requires high far-infrared optical depths to be excited. Using four water lines in total and the far-infrared/submillimeter/millimeter photometric data, we build a radiative transfer model that <em>resolves</em> the structure of the dusty ISM in the galaxy, which is composited of an optically thin 1 kpc disk with moderate dust temperature of 50 K and a very compact optically thick core with high dust temperature about 100 K. The disk component dominates the infrared radiation in total, yet the surface density of the infrared luminosity is much higher in the core, which has the characteristic properties of an Eddington-limited starburst.</p>

<p>CO lines are very useful for us to understand the properties of the molecular gas. By observing multiple transitions of the CO lines, namely the CO SLED, we can infer the excitation conditions of the molecular gas such as density, kinematic temperature. Here we conducted a large-sample study of CO SLEDs in 16 high-redshift &#40;\(z\sim2-4\)&#41; strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxies &#40;<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A&#37;26A...608A.144Y/abstract">Yang et al. 2017</a>&#41;.</p>

<br>

<p>Having a look at the averaged CO SLED, we discovered that the CO excitation of the high-redshift  dusty star-forming galaxies &#40;or submillimeter galaxies&#41; contains at least two components:  a low excitation component whose SLED is peaking around \(J_\mathsf{up}=5-6\) and a high excitation component peaking around \(J_\mathsf{up}=8\). This is similar to local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies &#40;ULIRGs&#41;  such as Arp 220. However, for the normal star-forming galaxies, the low excitation dominates  the overall SLED, which is different from ULIRGs and high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies.</p>

<p>To model the CO excitation, we have applied the LVG modeling with the RADEX code, with an MCMC approach with the emcee package &#40;see our RADEX&#43;emcee code <a href="https://github.com/yangcht/radex_emcee">here</a>&#41;. The advantage of directly combining RADEX with emcee compared to the grid approach is that the parameter space will be explored more thoroughly.</p>

Yang et al. 2017</a>. The figure shows the LVG modeling results. Upper left panel: The CO SLED of each source is plotted in black. The solid orange curve shows the best fit from the single component model corresponding to the maximum posterior possibility, while the solid purple line shows the best fit of the two-component model. Dashed red line shows the warmer component and the dashed-dotted line shows the cooler component fit. The upper limits are shown in grey open circles with downward arrows. Upper right panel: The posterior probability distributions of molecular gas density, kinematic temperature and CO column density per velocity of the source, with the maximum posterior possibility point in the parameter space shown in orange lines and points. The contours are in 0.5-σ steps starting from the center. Lower panels: The posterior probability distributions for n<sub>H2</sub>, T<sub>kin</sub> and N<sub>CO</sub>/dv of the cooler (dark green) and warmer (light green) component of the two-component model.

<p>Analyzing the extracted physical conditions, we find a tight correlation between the gas pressure and the star formation efficiency, after including some nearby galaxies. This suggests that the thermal pressure of the bulk of molecular gas is playing an important role in regulating the star formation at galactic scales across a range of redshifts.</p>

Yang et al. 2017</a>. Left: Thermal gas pressure plotted against star formation efficiency. Filled circles are the H-ATLAS SMGs. The color is coded based on their values of molecular gas density. The red line shows the fit to the correlation, which yields a slope of 1.1±0.5 for all the sources. Middle: Similar correlation plot as in the left panel but only for the cool component from the two-component LVG modeling. There is no correlation found. Right: Similar correlation plot as in the left panel but only for the warm component in the two-component LVG modeling. The dashed red line is an overlay of exactly the same red line plotted in the left panel. The data points follow the same correlation found in the single-component fit. In all the three panels, the legends show the Pearson’s correlation coefficient RP with the corresponding p-value. The values of n<sub>H2</sub> for each point are indicated by the color bar.
